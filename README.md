## About the Project

This is a simple game built in **JavaScript** for learning and practice purposes.  
How it works:

- The system generates a **random number**.
- The user must **guess** the number.
- The game tells the user if the guess is **higher** or **lower** than the correct number.
- The loop continues until the user gets it right.

## Learning Goals

- Practice **programming logic**.
- Work with **JavaScript functions**.
- Use **loops** and **conditionals**.
- Handle **user input**.
- Generate **random numbers**.
